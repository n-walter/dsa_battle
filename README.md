# DSA Battle Helper
DSA battles are too intricate and long-winded to carry out solely with pen and paper. I want to use this tool to simplify them and speed up the process so we can actually have fun even with larger battles.

## Planned features
### basic
- calculation & tracking of attack order
- calculation of *physical* attack & defense
    - manual input can be inserted instead of relying on "virtual dice" 
- differentiation between "simple" and "complex" characters (i.e. between random encounters like wolfs and more important characters such as the evil knight to be defeated)

### coming later
- delaying ("Zur√ºckstellen") of action in fight

## Future Features
These features would be nice to have but are not currently on my timeline to implement:
- hit zones ("Trefferzonen")
- special abilities ("Sonderfertigkeiten")
- magic abilities
- carmal abilities
